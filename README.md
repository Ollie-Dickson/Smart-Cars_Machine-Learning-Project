# Smart Cars - Machine Learning Project
In this project a population of cars learn to drive around a track using neural networks trained with a genetic algorithm. 
Each car's neural network uses distances to the track walls and current speed as the inputs. 
Constructed using p5.js libraries so it can be downloaded and run in a browser.


To run this program, simply download the project files and open the index.html file in your browser. It may fail to run initially, producing errors 
in the console relating to image import restrictions. This can be very easily fixed by running the program in a local web server. Here is an example 
of an easy to use web server application: https://greggman.github.io/servez/. Simply download this app, select the project folder for the Smart Cars 
program and hit the 'start' and 'launch browser' buttons.
